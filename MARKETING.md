# SquadRoll Marketing Research

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Steam Game Pickers)
| Tool | Status | Focus | Multi-player? |
|------|--------|-------|---------------|
| whatshouldiplayonsteam.com | Active but minimal | Your library | ❌ Solo only |
| lorenzostanco.com/lab/steam | Active | Library filters | ❌ Solo only |
| steamroulette.net | Loading screen only | Unknown | Unknown |
| steam-roulette.herokuapp.com | 💀 Dead (404) | - | - |
| steamgamepicker.com | 💀 Dead (DNS fail) | - | - |
| randsteam.com | 💀 Dead | - | - |

### Steam Official
- **Steam Labs Play Next** - ML-based recommendations, but:
  - Solo only (your library)
  - Not random/fun
  - Not group-focused

### Key Finding: **No one is doing multiplayer group game picking**
This is our moat. Every existing tool is "pick a random game from MY library" — none solve "what should WE play?"

- Fun factor matters
